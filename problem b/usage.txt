This program outputs a graph representation, there is splitted 5 checkpoint. But in josm file, there is really a way which is unconnected.

Also the graph is generated without lot, lan, only depends on vertices and edge weights. This does not effects shortest path algorithms, only the visualization can seems different. 


usage: python3 visualize_graph.py
